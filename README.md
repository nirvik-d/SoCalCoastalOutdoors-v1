# Southern Coastal California Beach towns and cities - Landmarks and Outdoors
- This project is an improvement over the previous projects.
- The project uses filters to prevent double drawing of polygons, thus reducing draw time.
- The project also uses multiple feature layers to provide accurate data on the existing beach towns and cities.
